# Dog Voice Synthesizer Architecture

## Overview
A sophisticated physical modeling synthesizer for realistic dog vocalizations using advanced DSP techniques.

## Core Components

### 1. Glottal Source Generator
- **LF Model**: Liljencrants-Fant glottal flow model with adjustable parameters
- **Parameters**: Rd (shape), Ra (return phase), Rk (open quotient), Rg (speed quotient)
- **Jitter/Shimmer**: Natural pitch and amplitude variations

### 2. Vocal Tract Model
- **Digital Waveguide**: Kelly-Lochbaum tract model with configurable sections
- **Wavetable Formants**: Pre-calculated formant shapes for efficiency
- **Dynamic Tract Length**: Adjustable for different dog sizes

### 3. Formant Filter Bank
- **Parallel Resonators**: F1-F4 with adjustable frequency, Q, and gain
- **Anti-formants**: For nasal coupling
- **Dynamic Control**: Real-time modulation capability

### 4. Envelope System
- **Multi-target ADSR**: Separate envelopes for:
  - Amplitude
  - Pitch
  - Filter cutoff
  - Breathiness
- **Curve Types**: Linear, exponential, custom shapes

### 5. Noise Generator
- **Colored Noise**: Pink/brown noise for naturalness
- **Turbulence Model**: Reynolds number-based intensity
- **Aspiration Noise**: High-frequency emphasis

### 6. Preset System
- **Dog Sound Presets**: Bark, Howl, Whine, Growl, Yip, Pant
- **Parameter Snapshots**: All synthesis parameters stored
- **Morphing**: Smooth transitions between presets

## Signal Flow
1. Glottal pulses generated by LF model
2. Pulses excite waveguide vocal tract
3. Tract output filtered through formant bank
4. Noise added for breathiness
5. Envelopes applied
6. Final mix to output

## Key Features
- **Modular Design**: Each component is independent and testable
- **Real-time Control**: All parameters adjustable during playback
- **Physical Accuracy**: Based on canine vocal tract measurements
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new components or presets
