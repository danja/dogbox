## Prompts

Refactor the code from html/dogbox_10.html so that the file locations become :

src/html/index.html
src/js/index.js
src/css/index.css

And the build process should be :

```sh
npm run build
```

Using webpack under the hood. You will need to create a webpack.config.js file. No need to bundle the files at this stage, just ensure the relative paths are correct. The output should be in the dist folder.

Refactor the code to use a MVC architecture in modern vanilla JS using ES modules for imports and exports. Communication between components should be via an event bus instance using the installed evb lib. You will find it has a types lib that you can use as a base to define the events.
Each piece of synth signal processing should be in its own class.
These should be in the src/js folder in files named after the class name, eg. LFGlottalSource.js
There should be a barrel file src/js/index.js
