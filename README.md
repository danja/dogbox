Dog vocalisation synth

## Usage

## Dev

Initial implementation was by the browser-interfaced Claude Sonnet 4, but this got stuck when trying to go beyond a simple subtractive synth. But it was a good starting point for Claude Opus 4 to be able to implement a more complex model. However the session tokens were used up by this point so dev continued in Windsurf using its SWE-1 model.
